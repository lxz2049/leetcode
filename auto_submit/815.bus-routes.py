#
# We have a list of bus routes. Each routes[i] is a bus route that the i-th bus
# repeats forever. For example if routes[0] = [1, 5, 7], this means that the
# firstÂ bus (0-th indexed) travels in the sequence 1->5->7->1->5->7->1->...
# forever.
# 
# We start at bus stop S (initially not on a bus), and we want to go to bus
# stop T. Travelling by buses only, what is the least number of buses we must
# take to reach our destination? Return -1 if it is not possible.
# 
# 
# Example:
# Input: 
# routes = [[1, 2, 7], [3, 6, 7]]
# S = 1
# T = 6
# Output: 2
# Explanation: 
# The best strategy is take the first bus to the bus stop 7, then take the
# second bus to the bus stop 6.
# 
# 
# Note: 
# 
# 
# 1 <= routes.length <= 500.
# 1 <= routes[i].length <= 500.
# 0 <= routes[i][j] < 10 ^ 6.
