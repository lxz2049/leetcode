# Testcase Example:  '[3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]'
#
# Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock
# on day i.
# 
# Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most two
# transactions.
# 
# Note:Â You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you
# must sell the stock before you buy again).
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
# Output: 6
# Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit =
# 3-0 = 3.
# Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 =
# 3.
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
# Output: 4
# Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit =
# 5-1 = 4.
# Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you
# are
# engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying
# again.
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
# Output: 0
# Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
