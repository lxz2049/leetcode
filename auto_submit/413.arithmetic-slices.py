#
# A sequence of number is called arithmetic if it consists of at least three
# elements and if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the
# same.
# 
# For example, these are arithmetic sequence:
# 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
# 7, 7, 7, 7
# 3, -1, -5, -9
# 
# The following sequence is not arithmetic. 1, 1, 2, 5, 7 
# 
# 
# A zero-indexed array A consisting of N numbers is given. A slice of that
# array is any pair of integers (P, Q) such that 0 
# 
# A slice (P, Q) of array A is called arithmetic if the sequence:
# ‚Å†   A[P], A[p + 1], ..., A[Q - 1], A[Q] is arithmetic. In particular, this
# means that P + 1 < Q.
# 
# The function should return the number of arithmetic slices in the array A. 
# 
# 
# Example:
# 
# A = [1, 2, 3, 4]
# 
# return: 3, for 3 arithmetic slices in A: [1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4] and [1, 2, 3,
# 4] itself.
