# Testcase Example:  '["ca","bb","ac"]'
#
# We are given an arrayÂ A of N lowercase letter strings, all of the same
# length.
# 
# Now, we may choose any set of deletion indices, and for each string, we
# delete all the characters in those indices.
# 
# For example, if we have an array A = ["abcdef","uvwxyz"] and deletion indices
# {0, 2, 3}, then the final array after deletions is ["bef","vyz"].
# 
# Suppose we chose a set of deletion indices D such that after deletions, the
# final array has its elements in lexicographic order (A[0] <= A[1] <= A[2] ...
# <= A[A.length - 1]).
# 
# Return the minimum possible value of D.length.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: ["ca","bb","ac"]
# Output: 1
# Explanation: 
# After deleting the first column, A = ["a", "b", "c"].
# Now A is in lexicographic order (ie. A[0] <= A[1] <= A[2]).
# We require at least 1 deletion since initially A was not in lexicographic
# order, so the answer is 1.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: ["xc","yb","za"]
# Output: 0
# Explanation: 
# A is already in lexicographic order, so we don't need to delete anything.
# Note that the rows of A are not necessarily in lexicographic order:
# ie. it is NOT necessarily true that (A[0][0] <= A[0][1] <= ...)
# 
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: ["zyx","wvu","tsr"]
# Output: 3
# Explanation: 
# We have to delete every column.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# 1 <= A.length <= 100
# 1 <= A[i].length <= 100
# 
#
