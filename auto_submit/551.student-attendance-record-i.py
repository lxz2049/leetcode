#
# You are given a string representing an attendance record for a student. The
# record only contains the following three characters:
# 
# 
# 
# 'A' : Absent. 
# 'L' : Late.
# ‚Å†'P' : Present. 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# A student could be rewarded if his attendance record doesn't contain more
# than one 'A' (absent) or more than two continuous 'L' (late).    
# 
# You need to return whether the student could be rewarded according to his
# attendance record.

# Example 1:
# 
# Input: "PPALLP"
# Output: True

# 
# Example 2:
